        <h4>2024-11-08</h4>
        <p>Transmission. We report from evensong. </p>
        <h4>2024-11-07</h4>
        <p>[11:18] Transmission. We report from high fog, pregnant with drizzle. Wind southerly. We have received permission to speculate on the thoughts of the labourer we saw last week. We imagine him to dream of ghosts; empyreal reminders of love lost and paths contemplated but never taken.</p>
        <h4>2024-11-06</h4>
        <p>[10:48] Transmission. We report from an uneasy morning. Wind variable becoming easterly or southeasterly. The days begin almost by accident now; hastily some light is remembered only to give reason to the marching dark.</p>
        <h4>2024-11-05</h4>
        <p>[06:29] Transmission. We report from beneath ribbons of light, tossed gently across bracken. Wind easterly. We have stopped at the bank of an oxbow lake to observe the spruce pine and brew strong tea. There, we savoured the stillness of the day and committed it to our thoughts.</p>
        <h4>2024-11-04</h4>
        <p>[03:57] Transmission. We report from the end of a lost weekend. Wind southerly. Already we have witnessed the dayâ€™s first procession of orphan trucks bound for foreign shores. Through misting rain we watched their steady advance, their cardinal lights gliding into the morning like pearls on a string.</p>
        <h4>2024-11-03</h4>
        <p>[15:22] Transmission. We report from a faraway November, somewhere underneath the soft hum of our radio unit. Wind variable, becoming mainly southerly or southeasterly. A short while ago we picked up the start of a friendly conversation between two fishing vessels but when the wind changed the signal was lost.</p>
        <h4>2024-11-02</h4>
        <p>[16:30] Transmission. We report from the last clutches of lingering light. Wind south veering west or southwest. We greet the early twilight as a stranger, unsure of the coming winter's motives. </p>
        <h4>2024-11-01</h4>
        <p>[09:03] Transmission. We report from the morning, where the sky, defiant refuses to give up her colours. Wind westerly. We have crossed paths with a walker, who sought refreshment at our post. The cuff of his trousers was wet from spray and his boots were spattered with clod. He spoke to us for a time of the strange dreams that have troubled him this week, and requested our literature.</p>
