        <h4>2024-11-03</h4>
        <p>[15:22] Transmission. We report from a faraway November, somewhere underneath the soft hum of our radio unit. Wind variable, becoming mainly southerly or southeasterly. A short while ago we picked up the start of a friendly conversation between two fishing vessels but when the wind changed the signal was lost.</p>
        <h4>2024-11-02</h4>
        <p>[16:30] Transmission. We report from the last clutches of lingering light. Wind south veering west or southwest. We greet the early twilight as a stranger, unsure of the coming winter's motives. </p>
        <h4>2024-11-01</h4>
        <p>[09:03] Transmission. We report from the morning, where the sky, defiant refuses to give up her colours. Wind westerly. We have crossed paths with a walker, who sought refreshment at our post. The cuff of his trousers was wet from spray and his boots were spattered with clod. He spoke to us for a time of the strange dreams that have troubled him this week, and requested our literature.</p>
